# Declarative Examples

This folder is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples for writing Declarative Pipelines with the
[Jenkins Pipeline plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

# Layout

The repository is broken up into two directories currently:

* *simple-examples* - simple pipelines with one or two stages that illustrate or test a single part of Declarative Pipeline
* *jenkinsfile-examples* - for examples of using `Jenkinsfile`s checked into repositories.


When contributing new examples please put them into the appropriate directory above. Make sure your script is commented so that others can understand how it works, why it works, etc.

# License

All contributions are under the MIT license, like Jenkins itself.

# Pull requests

We want them!
